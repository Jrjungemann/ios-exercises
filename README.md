\nNow, this is a story all about how,
my life got twisted upside down.
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there, 
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.

In west Philadelphia, born and raised,
on the playground is where I spent most of my days.
Chillin' out maxin', relaxin' all cool, 
and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school.
When a couple of guys, who were up to no good, started makin' trouble in my neighbourhood.
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
she said, Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.

I begged and pleaded with her day after day,
But she packed my suicase and sent me on my way.
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket,

First class, yo this is bad.
Drinkin' orange juice outta a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?
Hmmmmmmm. This might be alright.

But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeouis, and all that,
Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?
I don't think so,
I'll see when I get there,
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air.

Well, the plane landed and when I came out,
There was a dude who looked like a cop and was yellin' my name out.
I ain't tryin' to get arrested,
man, I just got here!
I sprang with the quickness, like lightin', disappeared.

I whistled for a cab and when it came near,
the license plate said Fresh and had dice in the mirror!
If anything, I could say that this cab was rare,

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight,
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there.
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.
